# :clock4: BTime 
>*Never be late*


**BTime**, your new personal command line assistant that manages all your personal daily and weekly reminders.

Sounds fancy, but under the hood, it's just a python script that helps you schedule and manage more efficiently your **cron** time-based Unix-like tasks. 
  

## Installation
To install *BTime* in a Unix system, follow these steps:

### Requirements

+ Make sure you have `git` installed.
    ```
    sudo apt-get install git
    ```


+ Make sure you have `pip` or `pip3` installed.
    ```
    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    ```

+ Make sure you have `notify-send` installed from `libnotify-bin`.

    ```
    sudo apt install libnotify-bin
    ```

+ Make sure you have `play` installed from the `sox` package.

    ```
    sudo apt install sox
    ```


### Steps

+ Install `python-crontab` library:
    ```
    pip3 install python-crontab
    ```


+ Install `simple-term-menu` library 
    ```
    pip3 install simple-term-menu
    ```


+ Navigate to the directory you want to install *BTime*
    ```
    cd /home/username/<my_btime_directory>
    ```
    
    
+ Clone this repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/MiquelEspinosa/BTime.git
    ```


+ Move inside *Never-be-late* directory:
    ```
    cd BTime
    ```
    

+ Add **btime** alias to your bash profile (if you are using bash). (**Important:** Make sure you run this command inside the *Never-be-late* directory.)
    ```
    echo 'alias btime="python3 '$(pwd)'/main.py"'  >> ~/.bashrc
    ```
    + If you are using zsh, run instead
        ```
        echo 'alias btime="python3 '$(pwd)'/main.py"' >> ~/.zshrc
        ```


+ Source your bash or zsh profile by running: 
 	+ For bash
      ```
      source ~/.bashrc
      ```
 	+ For zsh
      ```
      source ~/.zshrc
      ```


+ Finally, you should see a welcoming message when you run:
    ```
    btime show
    ```
